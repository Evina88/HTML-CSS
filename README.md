# HTML-CSS
Homework for Social Hacker Academy

Week 1 was about making a web resume. One webpage with two files: HTML and CSS. Include personal information, 
a few lines about me, education & work experience.

Week 2 was about building on an existing project and making it responsive for various devices.

Week 3 was a test. In this project I rebuilt the homepage of an existing responsive website (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl) from scratch.
